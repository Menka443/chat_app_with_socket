# ðŸ’¬ Chat App with Socket (Android + Java Server)

This project is a **Chat Application** built to practice **two-way communication** using **Sockets**.  
The client side is developed as an **Android app**, and the server side is implemented in **Java**.  
Through this project, I learned how clientâ€“server communication works over sockets in real time.

### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Understand how **Socket programming** works in Java  
- Implement **two-way communication** between client and server  
- Connect an **Android app (client)** with a **Java server (backend)**  
- Send and receive chat messages in real time  

### ðŸ“Œ Features
- Android app acts as a **Socket client**  
- Java program acts as a **Socket server**  
- Real-time message exchange between client and server  
- Simple UI for chat on Android side  
- Basic understanding of networking in Android  

### ðŸš€ Future Scope
- Add multiple clients support (group chat)  
- Improve UI/UX for chat screen  
- Add persistent chat storage (Room/SQLite)  
- Implement user authentication (login/register)
